## Week One Confessions from our Ruby on Rails Student Developer Posse

### To the DaVinci Community,

Our first class was on Monday, September 14, 2015. We began class by
introducing ourselves to each other with our “17 interesting things”.
This allowed everyone to get to know each other a little bit and ease
any preexisting tensions. We have a diverse team, for example: Sergey is
originally from Ukraine, we have several rock climbers, cyclists, one
epidemiologist, and a nurse. We are a unique bunch!

We then sat down at our computers to figure out what all of the
applications were that we had installed during Installfest. We
viewed a presentation of each application, making sure everyone had
indeed installed it, and learned its function and purpose. The list
includes: Chrome, RubyMine, GitX, Anki, Evernote, Skitch, Flycut,
Spectacle, Growl, Google Plus, Slack, Heroku, and BitTorrent Sync. All of these applications and programs make-up what is needed, not just for the course, but for professional, junior Ruby on Rails developers.

Like every first class, we also covered what is expected of us in
this course. We reviewed the syllabus, the do’s and don’ts, and of
course; watching Pat Morita throw-down some knowledge on Ralph
Macchio.

On Wednesday, we learned how to learn.  Not just how to learn
programming, but variety of useful and proven techniques to
accelerate and solidify our understanding of any given topic and become well versed on many different topics. Among the most useful techniques were the repetition of freshly learned
material, spaced repetition of the same material over a period of time
along with the “interleaving” of different
concepts while studying to keep our memory nimble. Another form of
learning that has been found to actually assist, rather than inhibit
the learning process is called generation. In doing so, the learner
engages in generating a possible solution to a problem that they
haven’t been shown how to solve yet. These, along with a few other
learning methods, will be our newfound approach on learning how to
code in the next 12 weeks.

We were also introduced to Pivotal Tracker and it’s features and functionality. Jason instructed us on best practice while using Pivotal Tracker for our
homework assignments and general workflow. For some of us this was our first exposure to real working definitions of what a‘feature’, ‘bug’, ‘chore’, and ‘release’ are. Gaining new insight into
the software held promise of a structured and productive protocol in our method to doing work in the class as well as in the real world.

TGIF! Our first Friday started off with a quiz on what we learned on
Wednesday. We weren’t expecting it to be too difficult, but Jason did
throw us a couple of curve balls. After grading the quizzes and
assigning points to all the posses, we started our intro to Git and
its staging areas.

Going over Git was when we first really started working with
command lines. We initialized a new git repository in iTerm and went
over init, status, add, commit, and push (push it real good). We
committed a few changes to the practice repo to get a good handle with
how to use git.

The final subject of the week was more Pivotal Tracker. While it was
primarily covered on Wednesday, we needed to spend some more time on
Friday to review because of its importance to the workflow and
submission of our assignments. Our assignment on this was to finish the first chapter
of ‘Learn Command Line the hard way’ and submit it as a Pivotal
Tracker story.

It feels like week one breezed by (only 12 more to go!). We’ve got a
lot to look forward to and a lot of hard work left. If week one is any
indication, it appears we’ve got a great instructor, teacher assistants, mentors and some
pretty cool peers. We can’t wait to see what everyone develops for their final project on that end of the bootcamp!

Sincerely,

von Neumann posse, t3-2015
